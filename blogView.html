    To start off the year, I'm finishing this site.</hl>
</em>
<hr>

I've wanted to commit to some sort of blog or documentation archive for my work- it's nice seeing growth. It would have
been cool to do this from the get go, but being 18, it can serve as something ive started at the beginning of my adult
 life, and hopefully will be something I continue and maintain far into the future.<br>
This will serve to be something between an archive of my own thoughts and ramblings, and my own notes and tutorials
    catered entirely to myself.<br>
<strong>My new years resolutions are to:</strong>
    <ol>
    <li>Create at least <hl>one project a week</hl>, with a different focus, <hl>documenting it here</hl> along the way.</li>
    <li>Take a walk every day.</li>
    <li>Get my nutrition and sleep in check.</li>
</ol>
    I don't have much else to put here today, except that I hope I get this up and running soon!
